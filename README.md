# viatui

## Overview

`viatui` is an experimental project exploring the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with UI testing. The project aims to leverage LLMs to analyze screenshots of UIs, perform actions like clicking, and report on the results. This approach is at the forefront of combining AI and UI testing. The concept isn't fully fleshed out yet.

## Experimental Nature

- The code in `viatui` is primarily pseudocode, serving to illustrate the conceptual framework.
- This project is a starting point for discussions and further development in AI-driven UI testing.

## Modules

- `move_cursor.py`: Demonstrates cursor movement based on grid positions.
- `screenshot_grid.py`: Captures and processes screenshots for analysis by LLMs.
- `more to come...`

## Documentation

- **Virtual Screen and Screenshot Guide**: Details on setting up virtual screens for capturing UI states.

## Vision

- Utilize LLMs to interpret UI elements from screenshots.
- Automate UI interactions based on LLM analysis.
- Develop methods for intelligent, automated UI testing.
